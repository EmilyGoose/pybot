# pybot
Bot for Slack built in Python

This is a side project of mine, which hopefully eventually will make it easy to keep track of ideas my team has for upcoming hackathons.
Feel free to use my code, but please credit me (preferably via direct link to this repo). I try to comment it where possible.
